# Godot Minimal Theme

## Installation

1. Download the `minimal_theme.tres` file of the [latest theme version](https://github.com/passivestar/godot-minimal-theme/releases/latest).
2. Open `Editor Settings -> Interface -> Theme` and choose the downloaded file in the `Custom Theme` field. You need to have `Advanced Settings` enabled to see it.
3. Click `Save & Restart`.

## Recommended settings

Minimal theme supports all editor settings. My recommendations are:

`Editor Settings -> Interface -> Theme`:

- Base Color: `#252525`
- Accent Color: `#569eff`
- Contrast: `0.25-0.3`
- Icon Saturation: `2`
- Corner Radius: `4-5`

`Editor Settings -> Interface -> Editor`:

- Main Font: [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)

## Compatibility

This theme was tested with Godot 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5.
